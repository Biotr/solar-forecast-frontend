# Solar Forecast
Solar Frontend is a weather and solar energy forecast application, built as part of an internship assignment.
The app is developed using React + Vite and integrates with an [solar-forecast-backend](https://github.com/Biotr/solar-forecast-backend) API.
In the application, users can either enter latitude and longitude manually or set a marker on the map to retrieve a 7-day forecast, which includes:
- maximum and minimum daily temperatures
- estimated potential solar energy production
- summary of the 7-day weather, including min and max temperature, average values for pressure and sunshine duration

The application is available at [Solar Forecast](https://solar-forecast-frontend.onrender.com/)

### Important info
Please give some time for app to load as render says: <br/>
`Your free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more.`

## Todo:
- create efficiency, power inputs
- handle loading
- create find city input
